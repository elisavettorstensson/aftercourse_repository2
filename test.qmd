## Procedure 

Note: the assigned HD member can ask the co-handling HD member for assistance in any of the steps below.

1.  The FEGA Sweden Helpdesk (HD) member changes the issue status to **“In Progress”** when starting to work on the issue.

2.  The HD member **evaluates** if the submission request falls **within the scope of FEGA Sweden**:

    -   Is the data of a supported type? (see documentation on [preparing data](https://fega.nbis.se/submission/preparing-data.html))
    -   Does sharing of the data require controlled access?

3.  If the submission request falls **outside the scope of FEGA Sweden**, the HD member sets the issue status to “closed” and informs the submitter (via Redmine) about the decision to not proceed with the request, including a short motivation (see template [Decision to not proceed with out of scope submission](../text-templates/submission-text-templates.html#decision-to-not-proceed-with-out-of-scope-submission)).

4.  If the request falls **within the scope of FEGA Sweden**, the HD member contacts the submitter (via fega-sweden@nbis.se) to provide **additional information using the PDF form** for personal data and study information. The PDF form can be downloaded from the internal FEGA Sweden documentation (see [Submission Request Assessment Form](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uFLk4j5dl4jRE5JGoKNuJJsNhQ1ydotL)). The submitter is instructed to fill out the form and return it together with all related ethics applications and approvals that help identify the data controller (personuppgiftsansvarig).

5.  Once the form is received, the HD member uploads both the **completed PDF form** and the **ethical documentation** to the Redmine issue. The HD members review the uploaded material.

6.  The HD member checks if Uppsala University has established a **general data processing agreement** with the data controller for depositing data in FEGA Sweden (see [existing general processing agreements](https://fega.nbis.se/submission/complying-with-gdpr.html#do-you-have-a-data-processing-agreement-with-us)). 

    - If such an agreement **exists**, proceed with step 7.
    - If **no agreement exists**, the HD member informs the submitter that FEGA Sweden cannot accept their data until a general data processing agreement has been established between the parties.
